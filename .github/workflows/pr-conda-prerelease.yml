          A conda pre-release package has been built for this PR: **${tag}**
          
          ### Package Info
          - **Version**: \`${version}\`
          - **Built using**: Same process as conda-release.yml workflow
          - **Pre-release tag**: Uses tag created by PR Pre-release workflow
          - **Artifact**: Available in GitHub Actions artifacts
          
          ### Installation Test
          ‚úÖ Package was successfully built and tested in a clean conda environment.
