"""
Core analysis engine for hydrogen bond and molecular interaction analysis.

This module implements the main computational logic for detecting and analyzing
molecular interactions including hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, and X-H...Ï€ interactions.

For better maintainability, this module has been split into several focused modules:
- interactions.py: Interaction data classes
- parameters.py: Analysis parameters
- analyzer.py: Main analysis engine

This file maintains backward compatibility by re-exporting all classes.
